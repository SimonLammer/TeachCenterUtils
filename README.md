# TeachCenterUtils

TeachCenter generates a zip file containing one folder for every submission, named `Student Name_123456_type2_type_`.
The student name may (and usually does) spaces.
The number after the student name is some submission id.
`type2` has always been `assignsubmission` in my experience.
`type` is the submission type which may either be `file` or `onlinetext`.

The goal of this repository is to assist in handling the examination of the submissions.
